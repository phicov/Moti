# Motivator
App that helps people with motivational problems and self-discipline issues.



The idea I have in mind is a project that helps inspire and motivate you. It's similar to instagram and tiktok where you can scroll through photos and videos that will help inspire you.
You are able to upload photos and videos yourself and have your own account.
4 Different Pages: Home (Basic Feed), search, profile, and quotes (a page dedicated to quotes to help you stay focused).
